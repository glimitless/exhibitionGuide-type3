                Living Paintings, Refik Anadol’s first major solo exhibition in Los Angeles will open at Jeffrey Deitch on 
                February 14, 2023. The exhibition will showcase the complete series of Anadol’s artworks that are based on 
                California-related datasets, and explore his fascination with the environments – physical, public, virtual, 
                and multidimensional – that play an instrumental role in shaping his artistic vision. Merging collective 
                memories of urban life and nature with groundbreaking machine learning and visualization technologies, Living 
                Paintings invites a poetic and futuristic contemplation of purposeful human-machine collaborations.

            <h3>Artist Bio:</h3>
            <p>
                Refik Anadol (b. 1985, Istanbul, Turkey) is an internationally renowned media artist, director, and pioneer 
                in the aesthetics of machine intelligence. He currently resides in Los Angeles, California, where he owns and 
                operates Refik Anadol Studio and RAS LAB, the Studio’s research practice centered around discovering and 
                developing trailblazing approaches to data narratives. Anadol is also teaching at UCLA’s Department of Design 
                Media Arts from which he obtained his Master of Fine Arts.<br><br>

                Anadol’s body of work addresses the challenges, and the possibilities, that ubiquitous computing has imposed 
                on humanity, and what it means to be a human in the age of AI. He explores how the perception and experience 
                of time and space are radically changing now that machines dominate our everyday lives. Anadol is intrigued by 
                the ways in which the digital age and machine intelligence allow for a new aesthetic technique to create 
                enriched immersive environments that offer a dynamic perception of space.<br><br>

                By proposing the possibility of “post-digital architecture,” Anadol invites his audience to imagine alternative 
                realities by redefining the functionalities of both interior and exterior architectural elements. He tackles 
                this by moving beyond the integration of media into built forms and translating the logic of a new media 
                technology into art and design.
