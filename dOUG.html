            <p>
                In D.O.U.G._1 (2015), a small robotic arm uses a mounted camera with computer vision to mimic the artist’s 
                hand drawing gestures and synchronously draw along her. D.O.U.G._2 (2017) is an exploration of robotic 
                memory and machine learning as robotic arms generate sketches based on neural nets trained on Sougwen’s 
                drawings gestures. Now, you can draw with D.O.U.G._4.
